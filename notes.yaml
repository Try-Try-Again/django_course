#STUFF TO DO FOR NEXT PROJECT:
#
#use pipenv
#use test driven developement
#
#PART 1
#
#create git repo for your new project
#
#create a pipenv (pipenv install django)
#
##once inside your virtual env, you can check the version of a package with...
#python -m django --version
#
##to start a new django project...
#django-admin startproject <project_name>
#
#default django filesystem
#.
#├── django_project  #
#│   ├── __init__.py #empty file
#│   ├── settings.py #config file
#│   ├── urls.py     #set up mapping from urls to user
#│   └── wsgi.py     #api beteen python and the webserver
#└── manage.py #allows you to run command line commands
#
#PART 2
#
#django projects hold mutiple django apps - each one can be a different part of
#your web application
#
##you can start a new django app inside your new django project with...
#
#python manage.py startapp <appname>
#
##create one called blog...
#python manage.py startapp blog
#
#open ./blog/views.py
#
#add the following...
#from django.http import HttpResponse
#^this is used to return http responses when called
#
#def home(request):#this function returns a line of html code for a browser
#    return HttpResponse('<h1>Blog Home</h1>') #html for a browser to read
#^this small function demonstrates how HttpResponse takes html and creates
#an http response for a browser
#
#5:02
#
#create a urls.py file in your new app directory...
#django_project/blog/urls.py
#
#this will behave similarily to the project urls file.
#
#we can copy stuff from the project urls file to start our new one
#from django.urls import path
#urlpatterns = [
#    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
#]
#
#you also need to import the views file from your working dir
#
#from . import views
#
#right now the above url pattern says 'admin/', admin.site.urls,
#but we need to change that to make the blog home page.
#
#path('', views.home, name='blog-home')
#     ^empty means this is the home path for 'blog'
#         ^this is what we're connecting to that path
#                     ^this is the name we're giving this pattern
#
#after you add that you need to go back to django_project/urls.py
#and route traffic to the blog
#
#to do this we need to import more stuff from django...
#from django.urls import path, include #all we added was ', include'
#
#now we can add the blog url pattern to django_projects/urls.py
#
#path('blog/', include('blog.urls')),
#
##dont trip if perian data uses regex to match paths
#
#after you edit some stuff, you wont be able to go to the debug homepage
#
# 11:30 we got it running
